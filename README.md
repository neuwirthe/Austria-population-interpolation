# Austrian population interpolation

[Statistik Austria](https://www.statistik.at) is publishing yearly data about population numbers grouped by community, 1-year age groups and gender.

These data are available at the [data repository](https://data.statistik.gv.at/web/catalog.jsp#collapse7) under the items `Bev√∂lkerungsstand ----` for each year.

For more detailed analyses, we need weekly interpolated numbers, and this repository contains a toolkit to create these interpolated data sets with R.
